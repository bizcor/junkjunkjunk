# git-vdiff

A utility program I wrote to help me see git diffs visually.  Prints to stdout vimdiff invocations.  Each invocation compares a file in a commit with its previous version.  If GIT_VDIFF_USER is set in the environment, the program uses it as a search string to identify the author whose commits should be examined.  If GIT_VDIFF_USER is not set, the value of USER in the environment is used.  If ALWAYS_INCLUDE is set in the environment, it is taken to be a list of sha's of commits to be processed irregardless of the commit author.  If GIT_VDIFF_DEBUG is set in the environment, then list all parsed data rather than execute the functionality described above.
